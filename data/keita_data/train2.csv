3cfeab7efcc187d6,""": ON ARTICLE SHOLIYARKAL Dear Mr. Appleyard. it has been noted that groups intending to spread misinformation and lies have used wikipedia well.The article on """"iyers""""(pls explain the meaning of this word and its origin) and its various subsects(again rubbish and libelious non-sense), clearly proves that the entire work up is a trash. Let me tell you that there has been no such thing called """"tamil brahmin"""" or ethnic """"tamil"""" as """"people"""" understand the term now. all these partisanship has been late medieval age concotion of vested interests. It is very very interesting to note here that many of those who claim to be """"brahmins""""(numerous sects of the same actually sramanas(buddists and jains) of past) now may not have been so. So you were right in questioning as to if the word iyer could be confused with word liar.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
